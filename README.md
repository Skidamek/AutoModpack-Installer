# AutoModpack + Fabric installer
This is a forked version of the fabric installer that has been modified to support the automatic download of the automodpack mod to make it even simplier to play with friends that don't want to mess with downloading mods and such.

Use it as a normal fabric installer for the official minecraft launcher, minecraft server.

It supports all versions that [AutoModpack mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/automodpack) supports.

Based on https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-installer
